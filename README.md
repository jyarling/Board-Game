# Larry & Barney's Monopoly

This project contains a minimal Node.js application that lets multiple players
connect via their browsers and take turns rolling dice using WebSockets.

## Setup

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser. Each player can connect from
a different browser or device, join with a name, and roll dice when it's their
turn.
